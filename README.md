## TL, DR

> See [https://events.google.com/io2016/](https://events.google.com/io2016/) then see this repo's screen cap.

> **NOTE**: this Application was suspended by Play Store by violating ***'the impersonation policy'***. I have no time as well as no will to fix it again. So please use this as your own risk, but don't publish it to store again.
